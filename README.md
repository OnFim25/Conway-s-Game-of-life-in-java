# Conway's Game of Life â€“ Java Simulation

This is a hobby project implementing Conway's Game of Life in Java using a java GUI library as a personal exploration of simulation logic and basic GUI rendering.  
The code produces a working simulation, but is not optimized or heavily documented.

## Features
- Grid-based simulation with configurable size.
- Applies Conway's Game of Life rules to update cell states.
- Simple visual representation of live/dead cells.
  
## Limitations
- Code is not optimized and is very slow a porting attempt of the same code to python ended up in unbelivably slow speeds. but porting to C made it faster
- The starting generation is always completly random and the code is just a visual simulation with no user control

## Status
- Completed as a learning exercise
- No further development planned.
